# CoronaVirusPlots

My first experience with Pythong. I made an app that uses a scraper, which I wrote, that it gets the information about the coronavirus
cases and deaths. I added a sleep() command, so it can check once per day to update the data and make the plot.

## What I learned

* Developed the scraper.py, importing the BeautifulSoup module, to take all the useful information I wanted from the website.
* Getting used to files, how to open them, write on them, read them etc.
* Implemented the funcionality of modules like matplotlib, so I can use all the data that I scraped and saved, to plot the curve.
